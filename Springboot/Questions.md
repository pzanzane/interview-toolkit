### Spring Batch

#### Basic Questions:

1. What is a batch job, and how is it different from regular request/response processing in web applications?
   - Expected Answer: Batch jobs are long-running processes that typically handle large volumes of data, are executed in the background, and are scheduled to run at specific intervals. They are different from web applications which are typically request-response based.

2. What is Spring Batch, and why is it useful in batch processing?
   - Expected Answer: Spring Batch is a framework for processing large volumes of data in a systematic, repeatable, and robust way. It simplifies batch job management, transaction management, job scheduling, etc.

3. Can you explain the core components of Spring Batch?
   - Expected Answer: The core components are:
     - Job: Represents the whole batch process.
     - Step: A phase in the job, consisting of an item reader, item processor, and item writer.
     - JobRepository: Stores the status of the batch jobs.
     - JobLauncher: Used to launch the job.
     - JobInstance: A specific execution of a job.
     - JobExecution: Represents the running instance of a job.

4. How do you configure a simple Spring Batch job in Spring Boot?
   - Expected Answer: Discuss using annotations like @EnableBatchProcessing, defining jobs, steps, readers, processors, and writers using Java config or XML.

#### Intermediate Questions:

1. What is the role of ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter in Spring Batch?
   - Expected Answer:
     - ItemReader: Responsible for reading input data.
     - ItemProcessor: Responsible for processing the data (e.g., transforming or validating).
     - ItemWriter: Responsible for writing the processed data to a destination (e.g., database, file).

2. How would you handle job restartability in Spring Batch?
     - Expected Answer: Spring Batch has built-in mechanisms to restart jobs from where they failed, using the concept of JobInstance and JobExecution. This is done by maintaining metadata in the JobRepository that records job execution states, allowing you to resume the job from the last failed step.

3. How can you schedule a batch job in Spring Boot?
     - Expected Answer: You can use Springâ€™s @Scheduled annotation for simple scheduling or integrate with a more complex scheduling framework like Quartz for advanced scheduling needs.

4. What are chunk-oriented processing and tasklet in Spring Batch?
     - Expected Answer:
       - Chunk-Oriented Processing: Spring Batch reads data in chunks, processes them, and writes them in batches. E.g., reading 1000 records, processing them in chunks of 10, and writing them.
       - Tasklet: A simpler, single-step approach for batch processing, used when chunk-oriented processing isn't needed.


#### Advanced Questions:

1. How do you handle large datasets in batch jobs to avoid memory issues?
     - Expected Answer: Implement techniques like:
       - Pagination or partitioning.
       - Using JdbcPagingItemReader or JdbcCursorItemReader to fetch a subset of records.
       - Use chunking to break the process into manageable units.
       - Implement multi-threading for parallel processing using TaskExecutor or partitioned steps.

2. Explain how to implement parallel processing in Spring Batch.
     - Expected Answer: Use partitioning (splitting the job into multiple steps, each handling a subset of the data) or multi-threaded steps (executing steps in parallel by assigning different threads).

3. What are some best practices for exception handling in Spring Batch jobs?
     - Expected Answer:
       - Retry/skip logic using RetryTemplate.
       - Skipping faulty items with SkipPolicy.
       - Proper transaction management and rollback handling at the step level.
       - Using JobListener and StepListener for handling exceptions and state transitions.

4. How do you implement conditional flows in Spring Batch?
     - Expected Answer: Spring Batch supports conditional flows using decision steps (Flow and FlowBuilder). You can use JobExecutionDecider to decide the next step based on a custom condition.

5. How would you optimize the performance of a Spring Batch job that deals with millions of records?
     - Expected Answer:
       - Use chunk-oriented processing.
       - Implement multi-threading or partitioning for parallel processing.
       - Optimize database reads and writes (e.g., batching queries, using indexes).
       - Use appropriate reader/writer strategies (e.g., JdbcPagingItemReader for large datasets).

6. What is Spring Batchâ€™s JobRepository, and how is it utilized?
     - Expected Answer: The JobRepository stores the state of jobs (including job executions, steps, and job parameters) in a persistent storage (usually a database). It ensures that job state is maintained between restarts and failures.

7. Can you describe the difference between TaskExecutor and partitioning in Spring Batch?
     - Expected Answer:
       - TaskExecutor: Executes steps asynchronously with multiple threads. Itâ€™s suitable for multi-threaded step execution.
       - Partitioning: Divides a large set of data into smaller, independent partitions and processes them in parallel steps, each running its own thread or process.

#### Behavioral/Practical Questions:

1. Describe a time when you had to troubleshoot a failing Spring Batch job. What approach did you take?
     - Look for the candidateâ€™s experience with debugging, logs, error handling, and fixing issues in production environments.
     - How would you approach migrating a legacy batch job into a Spring Batch-based solution?

Expected Answer: The candidate should explain how they would identify the existing job's processes, configure Spring Batch components, and ensure seamless data processing with minimal downtime.
What tools or strategies have you used to monitor batch jobs in production?

Expected Answer: Mention tools like Prometheus, Spring Batch Admin, custom monitoring, or logging to capture job execution details and performance metrics.
